## Structural Design Patterns
There are 7 structural design patterns defined in the Gangs of Four design patterns book.

Pattern Name | Description
- | - 
Adapter | Provides an interface between two unrelated entities so that they can work together.
Composite | Used when we have to implement a part-whole hierarchy. For example, a diagram made of other pieces such as circle, square, triangle, etc.
Proxy | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Flyweight | Caching and reusing object instances, used with immutable objects. For example, string pool.
Facade | Creating a wrapper interfaces on top of existing interfaces to help client applications.
Bridge | The bridge design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client program.
Decorator | The decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.

```java
CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClientBuilder.create().build();
// send basic get
httpClient.execute(new HttpGet("http://www.google.com"),
    response -> {
        //handle response
        assertThat(response.getCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        String bodyAsString = EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity());
        assertThat(bodyAsString, notNullValue());
        return response;
    }
);
```

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Pattern Name | Description
- | - 
Template| Method	used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.
Mediator | used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.
Chain of Responsibility | used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.
Observer | useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.
Strategy | Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
Command | Command Pattern is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.
State | State design pattern is used when an Object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.
Visitor | Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.
Interpreter | defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
Iterator | used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.
Memento | The memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.
