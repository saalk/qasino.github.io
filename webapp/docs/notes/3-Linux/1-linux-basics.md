## Background
OS = An operating system is the software that sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.
Linux = 1992 open source OS similar to UNIX and based on a Unix clone Minix
Unix = 1969 OS for mainframe by AT&T, servers eg Solaris (oracle), AIX (ibm) and OSX (apple)
FreeBSD/OpenBSD = Berkeley Software Distribution rebuild of Unix but still licenced to AT&T
BASH = Linux default shell, UNIX has Bourne Shell
Gnome = GUI for Linux and Unix
DOS = 1981 MS DOS an OS that runs from a disk - its single task single user cli os
Windows = 1985 based on dos but with multitasking, multiuser and a gui os - 1992 windows 3.1 had minecraft and patience
C64 OS = 1982 written in Basic and was a ROM OS for C64 so a machine with OS

- In the past, RHEL was available at no cost, and users only had to pay for support.
-  However, Red Hat has since created two versions of RHEL

`less +G file // =-info | n/N-next/previous | g/G-begin/end`

`vi // gg/G - begin/end | i/esc - edit/command mode | :wq! or ZZ does write and quit`
