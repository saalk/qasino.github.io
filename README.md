# Coding Concepts

MVP, YAGNI and so forth apply to functionalities not flexibility and extensibility.
But the MVP principle never justifies brittle software. If software is brittle, it can’t be updated to reflect new needs, and often needs to be thrown out in a year. And if your software needs to be thrown out it is not viable. It is at best a prototype.

### DRY 
“Don't Repeat Yourself.” 
- have a single source of truth rather than copy-paste code
- aim is to reduce repetitive patterns and duplicate code and logic 
- in favor of modular and referenceable code

### KISS
“Keep It Simple, Stupid”
- goal is to prioritize straightforward solutions over complex ones
- clear and descriptive variable and method names

### YAGNI
“You Ain’t Gonna Need It”
- implement functionality only when it is truly necessary
- delivering the most critical features in a timely manner
